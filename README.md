# World_Weather_Analysis
Analyze WeatherPy weather data using Python 3.9.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Google Maps APIs and OpenWeather APIs

## Overview of Project

### Background
As an introduction to Python APIs, this project calls GoogleMaps and OpenWeather APIs in Pandas DataFrames with Python to analyze WeatherPy data. In the original project, I analyzed historic weather data from random locations to study the relationships between latitude and weather parameters, such as humidity, wind speed and cloudiness. The results of this analysis were visualized in linear regression scatter plots and Google Maps marker and heatmaps.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use Google Maps and OpenWeather APIs to get historical weather data to and filter the results based on user input preferences. As the results required a vacation itine

refactor the script to The results include a vacation search based on the filters, as well as a vacation itinerary with directions for the 4 chosen cities. 

## Results
to include weather description in the Google Maps figure marker layer, allow the user to choose preferred minimum and maximum temperature for their destination, then filter the data based on these preferences. 

### Deliverable 1: _A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type_

**Image 1: Ride-sharing data includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, and average fare per ride and driver.**


### Deliverable 2: _A multiple-line chart of total weekly fares for each city type_
**Image 2: The line plot shows total weekly fare by city type over the months of January through April 2019.**
lyzed to understand the motivators for taking PyBer rides in different city types.
